"""
    Routines for loading the SEN12MS dataset of corresponding Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 
    and simplified IGBP landcover for the 2020 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest.

    The SEN12MS class is meant to provide a set of helper routines for loading individual
    image patches as well as triplets of patches from the dataset. These routines can easily
    be wrapped or extended for use with many Deep Learning frameworks or as standalone helper 
    methods. For an example use case please see the "main" routine at the end of this file.

    NOTE: Some folder/file existence and validity checks are implemented but it is 
          by no means complete.
